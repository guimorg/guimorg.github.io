I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer who loves building components for automating the Data Science Lifecycle. Also a Data Scientist in the free time, always reading new papers about new ML models and applications and sometimes editing kernels on Kaggle.

Python is my language of choice, but I also love working with Golang. Docker and Kubernetes are two of the tools I'm most comfortable on using to build my applications.

VIM is my editor of choice and I always try on improving my skills using it. Shell Scripting is a must for everyone so I also automate a few boring stuff for my terminal using it.
