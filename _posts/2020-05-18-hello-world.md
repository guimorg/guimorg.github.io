# Hello World!

Hey everyone! This is my first post here, so I'll try explaining what this Blog is all about!

It's been a long time since I've been wanting to share some of my knowledge online; not that I am a source of knowledge in any way, but because I love collaboration, and also discussions about different views on the same subject. So, comments are more than welcome! I would love to hear some feedback and even some correcions if I'm wrong.

And here I will share some of my knowledge about some topics that I really love, and that I also work with:

- **Machine Learning**: well, _"You know, I'm something of a [data] scientist myself"_. So I always try to stay in touch with some new Machine Learning articles about applications, new frameworks, or new models. One of the things I am really passionate about is **Interpretability and Explainability**, mainly one of the hot topics in Ethical AI. But you will also find posts about Classical and Modern ML.
- **Software Development**: in my work tasks, daily I have to code. My favorite programming language is Python, but I've been trying to learn Golang lately, so sometime I'll post about software development: shell, Python, golang, Docker, Kubernetes, whatever comes to my mind!
- **General Stuff**: I will also post some general stuff about Technology and Machine Learning, some rants, some news...

Well, I think that's it for my first post! I will try posting regularly, so stay tuned!
